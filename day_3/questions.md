## Day 3 Questions

1. What is a conditional statement? Give three examples.

  * A conditional statement evaluates whether an expression is true or false.

  * A conditional statement, for example, could be used to check things like if an item is in stock, if someone is old enough to make a purchase, or whether or not they've applied a discount

2. Why might you want to use an if-statement?

  * if-statements add logic to your program which allow it to make decisions based on certain conditions.

3. What is the Ruby syntax for an if statement?

  ```
  if (some expresison == true)
    # do this
  end
  ```

4. How do you add multiple conditions to an if statement?

  * By adding an `elsif` 

5. Provide an example of the Ruby syntax for an if/elsif/else statement:

  ```
  if (some expresison == true)
    # do this
  elsif (some expresison == true)
    # do this
  else
    # do this
  end
  ```

6. Other than an if-statement, can you think of any other ways we might want to use a conditional statement?

  * Another way to use conditionals is with `while` loops. These loops with run continuously while an expression is true.
